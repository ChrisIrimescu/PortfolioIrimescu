            <h2>Sorting Visualizer.</h2>
            <p> A web development project showcasing the functionality of the Bubble Sort Algorithm, implemented using JavaScript to
                visually demonstrate its step-by-step process. The project includes an "Init" button to reset the numbers to be sorted
                and a "Play" button to start the sorting process, which is visually represented by colored bars that change during
                swaps, accompanied by sound effects for an enhanced experience.</p>

            <h3>Facial Recognition using Javascript.</h3>  
            <p3>A JavaScript project utilizing the Face API.js library to implement facial recognition directly in the browser. It detects and
                identifies faces in real-time using a web camera, offering functionality such as facial landmarks, expressions, and age
                estimation. This project highlights the power of lightweight, browser-based machine learning for applications in
                security, user interaction, and personalization.</p3>

            <h4>Authentication using facial recognition algorithms with anti-spoofing.</h4>  
            <p4>This constitutes the final bachelorâ€™s project. The work involves the analysis of metrics as well as the implementation of
                an authentication application using facial recognition algorithms. It consists of an anti-fraud system that verifies the
                authenticity of the captured image with the help of a convolutional network, supplemented by a filter that analyzes the
                frequency spectrum of the images. Resources used in the development of the project include: Programming
                languages: Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow libraries, etc.); The database was implemented using the FireBase cloud
                computing backend service.</p4>

            <p4>A remake in Unity of the famous 'Snake' video game. The control is made with W,A,S,D keys and the goal is to get as
                many points as possible without hitting the border or touching the 'snake's tail'.</p4>
